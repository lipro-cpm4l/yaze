.SH DESCRIPTION
.B yaze
is designed to provide an exact simulation of the Z80 microprocessor
on a Unix system.  In addition to the instruction-set emulator, a
CP/M basic i/o system is provided that can reference Unix directories
and Unix files containing images of CP/M disks.  When a genuine CP/M
operating system (ccp + bdos) or a clone system is loaded into the
emulator, a complete CP/M system is available, running on a Unix host.

The complete documentation is contained in the file yaze.doc.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
causes a summary of the system configuration to be displayed after
loading.
.TP
.B -b
gives the name of a file to be loaded into the emulated processor's
ram before the emulation is started.  The file is loaded at the
address given by the \fB-l\fR option, if one is present, or else at
the basepage (see \fB-p\fR).  If a bootfile is not specified with the
\fB-b\fR option, yaze looks for the file yaze.boot in the current
directory first, then in /usr/local/lib.
.TP
.B -l
the hexadecimal address at which to load and start the bootstrap file,
if a separate bootstrap is necessary.
.TP
.B -p
the top 2 hex digits of the location of the CP/M console command
processor.  Also the location to which bootfile is loaded if a
\fB-l\fR option is not present.
.TP
.B -s
a file containing monitor commands that are to be executed before
starting the emulator.  If no \fB-s\fR option is present, .yazerc from
the current directory or from the user's home directory is taken.
.TP
.B -z
the hexadecimal address in the emulated processor's ram of a 1KByte
area that should be reserved for use by an extended CP/M clone such as
ZCPR3.
.SH MONITOR COMMANDS
When the emulator is started it executes commands first from the
startup file, then from the tail of the command line (any strings
which follow the options) and then from the tty if neither the startup
file nor the command line included a "go" command.  Control can be
returned to the monitor by executing the CP/M sys.com command or, if
yaze was compiled with -DDEBUG, by sending it a SIGINT signal.

Command names can be shortened to a unique abbreviation.  If
\fByaze\fR was compiled with GNU Readline, command-line editing,
filename completion and history recall are available - see the
readline documentation.

The monitor commands are described in more detail in the file
yaze.doc.
