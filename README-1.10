This is the first release of yaze since version 1.06 came out about 2
years ago.

It was prompted by Michael Haardt's work on emulation of non-CP/M
Z80-Systems.  He contributed the io.c file and the bank switching
memory logic, which may provide a platform for running MP/M and UZI on 
the emulator.
